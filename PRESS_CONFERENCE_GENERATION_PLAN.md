- ✅ PressConferenceQuestion with Active Storage `question_audio` attachment
- ✅ PressConferenceResponse with Active Storage `response_audio` attachment
- ✅ Migration for `final_audio_url` field
- ✅ Status transitions working correctly (draft → generating → ready)

**Background Jobs:**
- ✅ ChatgptResponseGenerationJob - Text generation with league context
- ✅ QuestionAudioGenerationJob - Announcer voice audio for questions  
- ✅ ResponseAudioGenerationJob - Cloned voice audio for responses
- ✅ Job integration - Text job triggers audio jobs automatically
- ✅ Status updates - Jobs properly update press conference status on completion

**API Integrations:**

  end
  
  def list_voices
    # Gets available voices from PlayHT
  end
  
  def list_cloned_voices  
    # Gets user's cloned voices
